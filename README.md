# flowinGN
This repo contains code for the paper titled "Graph Networks as Inductive Bias for Genetic Programming: Symbolic Models for Particle-Laden Flows".

The folder structure is the following:
* "GNN_data_inhouse": training data for 30 particles, as generated by the inhouse flow solver.
* "GNN_results": models and recorded messages for each dataset and algorithm variant
* "GP_data": recorded edge messages during GNN training, later used as training data for the GP to replace network blocks by symbolic models
* "GNN_flowing.ipynb": Code to train GNN for our use case
* "GP_flowing.ipynb": Code to identify symbolic models from edge messages
