# flowinGN
This repo contains code for the paper titled "Graph Networks as Inductive Bias for Genetic Programming: Symbolic Models for Particle-Laden Flows".

The core of this repo constitutes the following files: 
* "GN_flowing.ipynb": Code to train a graph network (GN) for the problem at hand
* "GP_flowing.py": Code to identify symbolic models using genetic programming (GP) which replace the network blocks of the GN

The folder structure is the following:
* "data_inhouse": training data for 30 particles, as generated by the in-house flow solver.
* "GN_results": models and recorded messages for each dataset and algorithm variant
* "GP_data": recorded edge messages during GN training, later used as training data for GP to replace network blocks by symbolic models
* "GP_results": Equation files for various combinations of algorithms and datasets
